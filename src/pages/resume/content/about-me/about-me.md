I am a software engineer, who is interested in functional programming and static types.
Programming is my passion - the idea of creating digital applications with a power of a mind and technology fascinates me.

Professionally I am mostly working with TypeScript, building both frontend and backend applications.
In my personal projects I prefer to use Haskell and explore it's type system.

Persistent. Attentive to details. Goal-oriented. Supportive. Agile.  
At least that's what my colleagues are saying.
